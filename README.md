# BrickBreakers
My driver is the main class, it sets up the interface and window for the game. The Brick game essentially brings the game together. It implements all aspects of the game and revolves around the use of ActionListerner and KeyListener. I also made a bricks class which is a parent class, and with the use of abstraction and inheritance I was able to make various subclasses such as BlueBricks, RedBrick, as well as GrayBricks as shown in the hierarchy chart below, each has its own point value. I also used a 2D array as our data structure to scan through the bricks when the ball intersects with them, in result, the score counter increments by the specified amount.
